        <p>I love to play basketball. It is one of my favorite sports. When I grow up, I would want to be a buisness man. I live with my Mom, Dad, and sister and I am in 5th grade.

    <p>I like going out to places like the beach, woods, and trails. I also like going to parks, because I can play soccer, tag, hide and seek, and many other games. Mainly, we would go on a playground, go down slides, hang on the monkeybars, and so many more things.</p>
